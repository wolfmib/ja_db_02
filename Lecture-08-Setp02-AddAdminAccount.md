You're almost in, John! ðŸŸ¢ Superset is up and running at `http://localhost:8088` â€” now letâ€™s create your **admin user** to log in.

---

### âœ… Step 1: Open a terminal into the Superset container

```bash
docker exec -it ja_db_02-superset-1 superset fab create-admin
```

> If your container is named differently (check with `docker ps`), replace accordingly.

---

### âœ… Step 2: Fill in the prompts

You'll be asked for:

| Prompt        | Value you can use                  |
|---------------|------------------------------------|
| Username      | `admin`                            |
| User first name | `John`                           |
| User last name  | `Hung`                           |
| Email         | `john@jagroupai.com`               |
| Password      | your choice, e.g. `admin123!`      |

Once done, your admin user is created inside Superset!

### âœ… Step 3: Login

Go to:
```
http://localhost:8088
```

Login using:
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin123!` (or whatever you set)
