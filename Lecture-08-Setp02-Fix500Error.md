By log:  ❌ `sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table: user_attribute`


This means **Superset hasn't been initialized yet** — the DB structure is missing, including the `user_attribute` table.

---

### ✅ You need to run Superset's setup commands:

These MUST be run inside the Superset container once, after the container starts.

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step Fix

1. **Open terminal into Superset container**

```bash
docker exec -it ja_db_02-superset-1 bash
```

> If the container name is different, confirm with:
```bash
docker ps
```

---

2. **Run the Superset DB migrations and setup**

```bash
superset db upgrade
superset init
```

This will:
- Create all necessary internal tables (like `user_attribute`)
- Pre-load roles, dashboards, permissions

---

3. **Then restart Superset**

```bash
exit  # exit from container
docker compose restart superset
```

---

4. Now reload:
```
http://localhost:8088
```

✅ You’ll be back at the login screen — and no more 500 errors!
