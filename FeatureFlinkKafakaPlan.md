✅ Your Revised Flink-Kafka Architecture Plan
✅ Step 1: Already Complete
✔️ Docker Compose includes Flink and PostgreSQL
🔍 Confirmed: Flink UI is working at [localhost:8082]

Nothing more needed here. Solid.

✅ Step 2: Add Kafka + Zookeeper Docker Containers
✅ Goal: Flink consumes from a Kafka topic
⚙️ Add Kafka and Zookeeper to your existing docker-compose.yml
🔁 Run a test Kafka producer + Flink consumer to confirm streaming works

🔧 Suggested Adjustment:
Include Kafka UI (e.g. kafdrop) for local testing convenience.

Container	Purpose	Ports
zookeeper	Coordination	2181
kafka	Message broker	9092
kafdrop	Web UI to inspect topics	9000

✅ Step 3: Python Sync Script → Kafka
✅ Goal: Your python_sync_streamer.py downloads JSONs from Google Drive
✅ Then publishes them to Kafka topic (e.g. ja_commit_json)

🔧 Suggested Adjustment:
Use confluent-kafka or kafka-python package

Add a UUID or timestamp to each message key

Use ja_commit_json as your topic

✅ Step 4: Deduplication / Indexing Mechanism
✅ Goal: Python only pushes new JSONs
❌ Avoid re-sending old ones already streamed

🔧 Suggested Adjustment:
Maintain a synced_files_index.json in memory or local .cache/

Optional: Pull Kafka topic offsets or use a status log topic (advanced)

Keep logic stateless for now:

List Google Drive files

Compare to local synced_index

Only publish new ones

Optional Later:

Ask Flink to emit ACKs or write to status_log_topic

✅ Step 5: Flink → PostgreSQL + Superset
✅ Goal: Flink consumes Kafka stream, parses JSON, inserts to Postgres
✅ Superset reads from table ja_commit_log or latest_commit

🔧 Suggested Adjustment:
Use Flink SQL table connectors (Kafka source + JDBC sink)

Use event time for partitioning (if needed later)

Keep all commits in commit_log_history, and add latest_commit view with ROW_NUMBER() window function

📌 Final Adjusted Plan (Cleaned Version)
Step	Task	Tools
1	✅ Done – Flink + Superset + Postgres	Docker
2	Add Kafka + Zookeeper + Kafdrop UI	Docker Compose
3	Write python_sync_streamer.py to send commit JSONs to Kafka	kafka-python
4	Add local dedup logic or synced index to skip old files	Python cache
5	Create Flink SQL job to consume Kafka, write to Postgres	Flink SQL

Let me know when you're ready to do:
👉 Step 2: Add Kafka containers
I'll give you the docker-compose.yml Kafka extension + test producer commands.
